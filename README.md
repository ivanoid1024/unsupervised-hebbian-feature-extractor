# unsupervised-hebbian-feature-extractor
Machine learning algorithm based on hebbian rule and modificated wta that extracts features as most frequent patterns

Each weight vector (aka neuron) learns it's own pattern and adjust receptive field in process. WTA algorithm modified so only neurons that have same (or very close) receptive fields concurent each other. 
As resul we have embedings than consists of disentangled fearutes!
